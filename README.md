# SC2002-Object-Oriented-Design-and-Programming
This is our project on Object Oriented Design and Programming. This project features different OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism etc. The design considerations mainly consist of ECB.

## What this repository contains
- "Data Files and Instructions", it contains a copy of the three text files containing the inital data of the FYP System and a PDF of the same instructions to set up. 
- "FYP System", it contains all the Java source code required to run the program. 
- "JavaDocs", it contains the documentation of all classes and methods defined in the source code.
- "UML Diagram" is a PDF of our UML diagram showing the relationships, attributes and methods of all classes in the program.

## Setting-up Instructions
1) Running in IntelliJ IDEA CE
- Download and unzip the folder. For first time users, copy the three text files, <b>Projects.txt</b>, <b>Requests.txt</b> and <b>Users.txt</b> in the "Data Files and Instructions" folder and replace the text files in the "data" folder of "FYP System".

2) Running FYP System.jar in command prompt. (Windows/MacOS)
- For first time users, copy the three text files, <b>Projects.txt</b>, <b>Requests.txt</b> and <b>Users.txt</b> in the "Data Files and Instructions" folder.
- For Windows, go to C:\Users\Your Windows Signed-In Account Name. While here, create a folder called "data" and paste the three text files into the newly created "data" folder.
- For Mac, go to Users\Your Mac Signed-In Account Name. While here, create a folder called "data" and paste the three text files into the newly created "data" folder.
- To find the FYP System.jar file, go to FYP System > out > artifacts > FYP_System_jar

## Running the Program
1) Running in IntelliJ IDEA CE.

- Open the folder "FYP System" in IntelliJ
- Go to src > fyp > main 
- Then, run to start the program

2) Running FYP System.jar file in command prompt. (Windows/MacOS)
- Open Command Prompt
- Type in, "java -jar (file path to FYP System.jar)". For the file path to FYP System.jar, you can drag the FYP System.jar file to the command prompt/terminal.
